App at https://busdb.herokuapp.com/

My first app in php for a school project on databases.
The app is for organizing travel business trips.
Two users can use it for now.
A Secretary who:
- Can create a user for himself
- Has access to customer reservation data and contact information in order to contact them whenever necessary.
- May add new destinations to the database.
- Can organize and create new trips using the available destinations.
- Can create new customer data and make travel appointments if requested by customers.
- Can add and remove driver data.
And a customer who:
- Can see all destinations
- Create and edit hiw profile
- Can create a user for himself
